# Basic Collaboration Git Workflow:

1. `git pull`

   This updates your master branch with any changes that other people have pushed.
2. `git branch sree`

   This creates a branch called sree for you to make useful changes in.

3. `git checkout sree`

	 This changes which branch you're looking at to the one you just created so that you can make changes without the risk of interfering with other changes to the repo.

4. `git add <any files you created or changed>`

   This tells git you want it to commit the changes you're made to the files you've listed.
5. `git commit`

   This creates a commit with your changes to the files you've added.
6. `git checkout master`

	This changes which branch you're looking at to master in your local version of the repository -- any changes you've committed to myCoolStuff will disappear from the file system (but will reappear when you checkout sree).
7. `git pull`

	 This updates your master branch with any changes that other people have pushed -- we need to do this again because people may have changed things while you were working.
8. `git checkout sree`
	
	`git rebase master`

	 This appends the changes you've made in sree to come after whatever other changes people have made in master in a nice line.
9. `git checkout master`
	
	`git merge sree`

	 If you've done everything correctly, this should be a FAST FORWARD merge. This updates master to include the changes you made in sree.
10. `git push`

	 This pushes the changes you've made to the global repository (in this case, on Github). This will fail if your master branch is not up to date (which occurs when someone pushed changes while you were doing steps 7 or 8). If this fails, you should reset master to before your changes then repeat step 6.
11. `git branch -d sree`

	 This deletes the branch you created to make your changes. We don't need it anymore since those changes are in master. When you want to make more changes, start from step 1. Remember, you can have as many branched as you'd like and name them whatever you want.
